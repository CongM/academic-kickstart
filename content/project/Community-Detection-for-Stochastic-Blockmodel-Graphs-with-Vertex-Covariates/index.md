- Develop model-based spectral algorithms for clustering vertices in stochastic blockmodel graphs with vertex covariates; assess effects of observed and unobserved vertex heterogeneity on block recovery; employ Chernoff information to analytically compare the algorithms' performance and derive the Chernoff ratio formula for some special models of interest; evaluate via simulations and real data experiments on a diffusion MRI connectome data set.

- Key words: **Spectral Graph Inference, Chernoff Ratio, Stochastic Blockmodel, Vertex Covariates.**
